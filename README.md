This project uses the Graph data structure to solve Sudoku puzzles. Each cell in the puzzle is viewed as a vertex, which has an edge with all vertices that it can directly influences.

Puzzle set contained:
- 200 classic Sudoku puzzle (computer generated)
- 100 Killer Sudoku puzzle (computer generated)
- 15 Killer Sudoku puzzle copied from www.killersudokuonline.com/archives.html, with levels varying from 'Easier' to 'Mind Bending'.


Note: while all classic Sudoku puzzle can be solved instantaneously, difficult Killer Sudoku puzzle can take a long time to solve (due to insufficient solving technique).
